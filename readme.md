# This paper is a protest against 2FA
## Firtsly...
Why must I use my smartphone to simply get access to my stupid student projects?

Why can't you just give option for some project to require 2FA and for some not to?

What if I don't have a smartphone or I loose it or it get's too old to support your application or some dumbass politician in my country decides to block it?

Why can't you just allow people to think for their security for themselves?

## This will be here for the last days of DOOM of my account because I will not be able to use it thanks to some dumbasses from github that decide what's best for everyone else.
